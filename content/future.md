# Future



## Reminder: What is CodeRefinery?
- Teaching tools and best practices for version control and
  reproducibility in modern research software development
- Open, collaborative project looking for more members
- Over 40 workshops to over 1400 participants
- Typical workshop: <https://coderefinery.github.io/2022-03-22-workshop/#schedule>
- Lessons: <https://coderefinery.org/lessons/>
- Carpentries membership



## Biggest open problems

- How to give helpers and contributors more credit and visibility
- How to promote/engage new members
- We don't know how we should be in relation with Carpentries
- What are we? Non-profit? Institution collaboration network? Selling services?
- Funding and sustainability (but we have ideas: collaboration network)
