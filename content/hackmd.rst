HackMD
======

The name "HackMD" doesn't do this concept justice, nor do the more
common descriptions of "shared notes" or "collaborative document".  It
is a full replacement for chat: perhaps it could be called "parallel
2D chat" ?

**HackMD** itself is a web service for collaborative documents in
Markdown.  This isn't special to HackMD, but we have used it for its
scaleability, markdown support, and privacy in the "view" mode.

Advantages
----------

* Synchronous questions, no disadvantage for quiet people.
* Anonymous questions.
* Parallel answers by a large number of helpers.
* Easier to go back and review past questions during Q&A sessions
  (compared to scrolling through chat), for example finding important
  or unanswered questions.
* The above can make a course feel much more interactive than it would
  otherwise.
