# Teaching online

Is online teaching better or worse?  As usual for that question, "it's
all a trade-off".  We believe that many people tried to directly
translate in-person strategies to online, and teaching suffered.  In
some ways, this even revealed the flaws of in-person pedagogy (remove
some interaction and not much is left other than an info-dump).

in-person teaching.  For each disadvantage of each, think of ways to compensate.
