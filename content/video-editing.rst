Video editing
=============

Video recordings could be useful for people attending a course later,
but also are (perhaps more) useful for **immediate review and catching
up after missing a day in a workshop**.  For this, they need to be
released immediately, within a few hours of the workshop.
CodeRefinery can do this.

Summary
-------

* Basic principle: privacy is more important than any other factor.
  If we can't guarantee privacy, we can't release videos at all.

  - Disclaimers such as "if you don't want to appear in a recording,
    leave your video off and don't say anything", since a) accidents
    happen especially when coming back from breakout rooms.  b) it
    creates an incentive to not interact  or participate in the course.

* Livestreaming is important here: by separating the instruction from
  the audience audio/video, there is no privacy risk in the raw
  recording.  They could be released or shared unprocessed.

* Our overall priorities

  1) No learner (or anyone not staff) video, audio, names, etc. are
     present in the recordings.
  2) Good descriptions.
  3) Removing breaks and other dead time.
  4) Splitting videos into useful chunks (e.g. per-episode), perhaps
     equal with the next one:
  5) Good Table of Contents information so learners can jump to the
     right spots (this also helps with “good description”.)

* `ffmpeg-editlist
  <https://github.com/coderefinery/ffmpeg-editlist>`__ allows us to
  define an edit in a text file (crowdsourceable on Github), and then
  generate videos very quickly.



Exercises
---------

.. exercise:: Use ffmpeg-editlist to edit this sample video

   Prerequisites: ``ffmpeg`` must be installed on your computer
   outside of Python.  Be able to install ffmpeg-editlist.  This is
   simple in a Python virtual environment, but if not the only
   dependency is ``PyYAML``.

   * Download the sample video: http://users.aalto.fi/~darstr1/sample-video-to-edit.raw.mkv
   * Copy a sample editlist YAML
   * Modify it to cut out the dead time at the beginning and the end.
   * If desired, add a description and table-of-contents to the
     video.
   * Run ffmpeg-editlist to produce a processed video.

.. solution::

   .. code:: yaml

      - input: sample-video-to-edit.raw.mkv
      - output: sample-video-to-edit.processed.mkv
	description: >
        editlist:
          - start: 00:16
	  - 00:15: demonstration
	  - 00:20: discussion
          - stop: 00:25

   .. code:: shell-session

      $ ffmpeg-editlist editlist.yaml video/ -o video/

   Along with the processed video, we get
   ``sample-video-to-edit.processed.mkv.info.txt``::

     This is a sample video
