Why teach together?
===================

We usually say so much about the value of collaboration.  Despite us
saying this, our teaching is still far too alone.



Ways to teach together
----------------------

* Develop materials together - avoid duplication.
* :doc:`co-teaching`
* Extensive use of helpers and team leaders.
* HackMD for parallel and mass answers.


Challenges and disadvantages
----------------------------

* Materials

  * May not be perfectly tuned to your audience
  * May not iterate as fast as you need

* Co-teaching

  * Difficulty in finding a co-teacher
  * Required preparation and syncing time
  * It might revert to independent teaching if you aren't careful.
