Why teach together?
===================

We usually say so much about the value of collaboration.  Despite us
saying this, our teaching is still far too alone.  Covid-19 gave us a
kick that reduced our barriers and led to lasting changes in how we
taught (eventually leading to this very course).

Open Science / FAIR data is heavily emphazised these days.  But let's
add a "C" to FAIR: "collaborative".  Instead of people doing their own
thing and releasing, develop, iterate, and maintain **collaboratively**.



Ways to teach together
----------------------

* Develop materials together - avoid duplication.
* :doc:`co-teaching`
* Extensive use of helpers and team leaders.
* HackMD for parallel and mass answers.


Model: CodeRefinery
-------------------

* Before Covid-19, workshops were physically around the Nordics,
  instructors would travel (or already be there).

  * Maximum size: ~40 people
  * High workload per person

* After several small scaling attempts, now we have:

  * Two large workshops per year - livestream format
  * Combined organization efforts
  * Instructors from each location - on average two lessons taught.
  * Locations with staff can have **local breakout rooms**: physical
    place to help during exercises.

* Others in the world can register and interact using HackMD, but no
  promises of help.

* Content still available to anyone in the world: live + instant
  replay.

Model: Python for Scientific Computing
--------------------------------------

* Aalto Scientific Computing wanted to host a course, **Python for
  Scientific Computing**
* ASC came up with initial vision and announced it
* ASC hosted an open initial meeting, inviting any interested
  organizers or instructors
* We went over the plan and refined the topics and schedule.  We also
  decided things such as the date, organizers, and instructors for
  each lesson.
* Registration was open to everyone in the world, non-Nordic
  participants could watch via livestream.
* People prepared their parts and came together and presented.
  Organizers kept everything on track.
* **Compared to the amount of effort each person put in, the results
  were great.**
* A 2021 version also happened and was even larger.

Challenges and disadvantages
----------------------------

* Coordination

  * Finding suitable partners with the same vision
  * Coordination efforts (if others don't understand the vision).

* Materials

  * May not be perfectly tuned to your own audience
  * May not iterate as fast as you need

* Co-teaching

  * Difficulty in finding co-teachers
  * Required effort of syncing among staff
  * It might revert to independent teaching if you aren't careful.

* HackMD

  * Can possibly overload both student and teacher.



Advantages
----------

* You need to teach anyway, less effort if you combine.
* If done right, minimal extra effort for others to receive benefit (+
  you get publicity).
* It's natural to use many of the teaching strategies presented
  previously - this makes the course more engaging than a small Zoom
  event with minimal interaction.
