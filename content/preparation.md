# Pre-workshop preparation



## Remark

Don't worry if there are sections you do not understand. The main objective
is to have a baseline for our discussions, not to check your ability to teach
the lesson during the instructor training workshop.



## Pre-workshop survey

- Complete our pre-workshop survey. Your responses will help us to
  customize the workshop appropriately.



## Read "The science of learning"

- Read this short paper [The Science of
  Learning](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/files/papers/science-of-learning-2015.pdf)
  which provides a brief overview of some key evidence-based results
  in teaching. This paper is also used by [The
  Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) for their Instructor Training
  workshops.



## Lesson overview and teaching philosophy videos

- Watch at least two of recorded ca. 5-minute
  [lightning overview videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpLblYHCzJABvt25VY0wNIgbaQfTQaND7)
  introducing various
  [CodeRefinery lessons](https://coderefinery.org/lessons/)
  to get an overview of what we teach in CodeRefinery and also to be
  able to practice CodeRefinery teaching on day 2 of this course.

- Watch at least two of recorded
  ["this is my training philosophy" videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpLblYHCzJAAHF89P-GCjEXWC8CF-7nhX)
  which we will
  discuss in group discussions and which will form the basis for a group
  exercise.



## Go over a CodeRefinery lesson

- Please go through a [CodeRefinery lesson](https://coderefinery.org/lessons/) and find one
  topic/episode/aspect that you find interesting. During a group session you
  will be asked to present a topic/episode/aspect of your choice for 5
  minutes and get constructive feedback.
