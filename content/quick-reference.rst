Quick Reference
---------------

In a further-developed lesson, this would include a quick reference of
all the main points.  It can be used:

* To find important things while you are in a course
* To use as a reference when applying the material of the course
  later.

Lessons are explicitly designed to be read directly by the learners,
both during a course and independently.

For an example, see `git-intro's quick reference
<https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/reference/>`__.
