Backwards lesson design
=======================

It happens far too often: someone creates a lesson, but they think
about what is interesting to them, not what is important for the
learners.  In fact, an earlier version of this instructor training had
this very issue.

It is critical to backwards design almost any piece of communication,
especially something as widespread as teaching.

Summary
-------

As described in the reference above,

1. Understand your learners

2. Brainstorm rough ideas

3. Create an summative assessment to know your overall goal

   * CodeRefinery translation: think of the things your learners will
     be able to do at the end of the lesson.  Think simple!  The
     simpler the better.  Think of three main points they will
     remember, of which maybe one or two are a concrete skill.

4. Create formative assessments to go from the starting point to this.

   * CodeRefinery translation: think of some engaging and active
     exercises.

5. Order the formative assessments (exercises) into a reasonable order.

6. Write just enough material to get from one assessment (exercise) to
   another.

7. Describe the course so the learners know if it is relevant to them.


We can't emphasize enough how important it is to **know your end
state and keep it simple**.
