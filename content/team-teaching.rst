Team teaching
=============

One of the most significant improvemest of our teaching has been the
concept of **co-teaching**.

.. admonition:: Co-teaching

   Wikipedia: Co-teaching or team teaching is the division of labor
   between educators to plan, organize, instruct and make assessments
   on the same group of students, generally in the a common
   classroom,[1] and often with a strong focus on those teaching as a
   team complementing one another's particular skills or other
   strengths.

*This is not strictly an effect of moving online*.  However, the
larger number of instructors and larger audiences make this practical
on a wide scale.

Benefits
--------

* The course seems very interactive, much more so than expecting
  students to speak up.
* Quicker preparation time since co-teachers can rely on each other in
  unexpected situations.
* One co-teacher can be effectively learning at the same time and thus
  acting as the "voice of the audience".
* Great way to onboard new instructors
* More active minds means better able to watch and react to other
  feedback, such as HackMD or chat.



Exercises
---------

.. exercise::

   Divide into groups of two or three.  Choose one of the two models
   in the team-teaching page, and quickly (5 min) prepare a short
   topic (3-5 min) to team teach.  You can quickly scan the
   "preparation" section at the bottom.

   The challenge is not just to give the lesson, but to prepare the
   lesson quickly and rely on each other to give a good lesson anyway.
